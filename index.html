      <h2>What do we do?</h2>
      <p>
        Tough Cut Services, LLC is ready to tackle tough mowing environments with our Ventrac 4520Z tractor.
        We tackle challenging mowing environments and aim to reduce many hours of costly manual labor with
        increased safety.
      </p>
      <h3>On Safety</h3>
      <p>
        What makes our equipment a safer option than many conventional style tractors? The low-
        profile design of our tractor helps maintain a low center of gravity for optimized stability,
        especially when mowing slopes. The flex frame of the tractor provides for tighter turning radius,
        better stability, improved ground contact, consistent low ground pressure, and reduced turf 
        disturbance as compared to traditional, fixed frame tractors. Full time all-wheel drive helps 
        provide maximum performance in every situation. The unique ability to utilize the tractor's weight 
        transfer system and dual wheel installation help to further improve performance and reduce disturbance.
      </p>
